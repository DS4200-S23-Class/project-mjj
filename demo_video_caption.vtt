Diverting droughts with data, designing a visualization tool to drive water

2
0:00:02.007 --> 0:00:03.101
conservation efforts across

3
0:00:03.101 --> 0:00:03.719
Massachusetts.

4
0:00:03.700 --> 0:00:06.786
Welcome to our demo video. So for our first tab of our website, we have the

5
0:00:06.786 --> 0:00:08.868
motivation followed by the data as well

6
0:00:09.086--> 0:00:09.991
as the demo video which we will link

7
0:00:09.991 --> 0:00:11.303
after this, in addition to our final

8
0:00:11.303 --> 0:00:12.609
report. So let's start with our first

9
0:00:12.598 --> 0:00:13.568
visualization which is the

10
0:00:13.568 --> 0:00:14.615
Massachusetts region map. So

11
0:00:14.838 --> 0:00:15.815
specifically this region map will help

12
0:00:15.815 --> 0:00:16.191
us with

13
0:00:16.191 --> 0:00:19.174
the 1st and 2nd domain task that we will mention next. So
first you can

14
0:00:19.174 --> 0:00:20.327
see how you have a legend, with a

15
0:00:20.444 --> 0:00:21.821
 categorical color map, so representing the

16
0:00:21.821 --> 0:00:23.397
six distinct regions. So the purpose of

17
0:00:23.397 --> 0:00:24.703
this is to better allow users to

18
0:00:24.703 --> 0:00:26.174
understand which region they are coming

19
0:00:26.174 --> 0:00:27.809
from. So in essence, we can click on the

20
0:00:27.956 --> 0:00:29.080
different counties that we have marked

21
0:00:29.080 --> 0:00:30.638
here with markers and say you're from

22
0:00:30.762 --> 0:00:32.333
Worcester County, then you know you're

23
0:00:32.444 --> 0:00:33.280
part of the Central Region and you can

24
0:00:33.280 --> 0:00:34.533
keep that in mind as you filter for the

25
0:00:34.733 --> 0:00:36.397
next few visualizations. So next we have

26
0:00:36.838 --> 0:00:37.733
the line chart and scatter plot. So

27
0:00:37.733 --> 0:00:38.556
let's look at the scatter plot first. This

28
0:00:38.980 --> 0:00:40.097
helps to address the first task, which

29
0:00:40.097 --> 0:00:41.274
is determining relationship between

30
0:00:41.274 --> 0:00:42.368
rainfall values and drought levels among

31
0:00:42.368 --> 0:00:43.556
regions. So let's say we're interested

32
0:00:43.556 --> 0:00:44.850
in all three years as well as January,

33
0:00:44.850 --> 0:00:46.327
February, November, December, in addition

34
0:00:46.327 --> 0:00:48.103
to the first four regions. So once we

35
0:00:48.344 --> 0:00:49.615
select those, we can click the button to

36
0:00:49.615 --> 0:00:50.862
display the scatter plot. And in general

37
0:00:50.862 --> 0:00:52.556
you can, as a user, see there is a general

38
0:00:53.050 --> 0:00:53.915
positive correlation between drought

39
0:00:53.915 --> 0:00:55.291
severity and precipitation levels. So

40
0:00:55.291 --> 0:00:56.450
that helps to answer the first domain task.

41
0:00:56.586 --> 0:00:57.621
The second domain task is determining

42
0:00:57.621 --> 0:00:58.562
which regions tend to have more or less

43
0:00:58.562 --> 0:01:00.097
precipitation than other regions during

44
0:01:00.097 --> 0:01:01.227
one or multiple months across one or

45
0:01:01.227 --> 0:01:02.762
multiple years. So given this line chart,

46
0:01:02.762 --> 0:01:04.503
say we're interested in 2018 data,

47
0:01:04.503 --> 0:01:05.821
so this only shows data from one year

48
0:01:05.821 --> 0:01:07.380
across all 12 months. So it's pretty

49
0:01:07.380 --> 0:01:08.774
clear that Cape Cod and Islands seems to

50
0:01:08.774 --> 0:01:10.433
have the greatest precipitation, while

51
0:01:10.562 --> 0:01:11.744
Connecticut River has the lowest

52
0:01:11.744 --> 0:01:13.103
precipitation within the month of March

53
0:01:13.103 --> 0:01:14.568
and you can see that across, for instance

54
0:01:14.909 --> 0:01:16.591
July where the lowest is actually

55
0:01:16.803 --> 0:01:18.133
Cape Code while the highest is Connecticut

56
0:01:18.238 --> 0:01:19.527
River. So using this tool tip, it better

57
0:01:19.650 --> 0:01:20.715
allows you to understand comparisons

58
0:01:20.715 --> 0:01:22.609
within one month of one year and then

59
0:01:22.862 --> 0:01:23.850
say we want to compare across

60
0:01:23.850 --> 0:01:25.638
multiple years for a given month. So you

61
0:01:25.850 --> 0:01:26.891
can use a scatter plot and you can see

62
0:01:26.891 --> 0:01:28.415
how in general for Cape Cod and Islands

63
0:01:28.803 --> 0:01:29.450
they seem to have the greatest

64
0:01:29.450 --> 0:01:30.815
precipitation regardless of the year, so

65
0:01:30.815 --> 0:01:32.274
across all years. And you can test that

66
0:01:32.397 --> 0:01:33.603
out with all these other months. And

67
0:01:33.856 --> 0:01:34.809
then lastly we have the linked bar and

68
0:01:34.809 --> 0:01:35.786
scatter plot which helps to answer

69
0:01:36.044 --> 0:01:37.662
determining of a region whether they

70
0:01:38.056 --> 0:01:39.350
have a higher or lower SPI, whether

71
0:01:39.350 --> 0:01:40.621
that corresponds with a region having

72
0:01:40.621 --> 0:01:41.744
higher or lower annual precipitation

73
0:01:41.744 --> 0:01:43.550
totals. So say we are interested in 2018

74
0:01:43.944 --> 0:01:47.079
and we press submit and then from there say we click on this bar and

75
0:01:47.079 --> 0:01:49.980
 see that for Cape Cod and Islands the precipitation seems to

76
0:01:49.980 --> 0:01:51.068
be pretty low compared to the other

77
0:01:51.068 --> 0:01:52.191
regions, right? And you can see how

78
0:01:52.191 --> 0:01:53.862
there is five points to the left of the

79
0:01:53.862 --> 0:01:55.303
 X = 0 drought severity level and then

80
0:01:55.650 --> 0:01:57.133
say then we look at Central which has

81
0:01:57.674 --> 0:01:58.733
the highest annual precipitation and it

82
0:01:58.733 --> 0:02:02.110
only has like around 2 1/2 points to the right of the drought severity. So to some extent it does

83
0:02:02.110 --> 0:02:06.509
show that annual precipitation does correspond with SPI levels in the sense that greater annual precipitation leads to

84
0:02:06.509 --> 0:02:08.808
less drought severity as negative means

85
0:02:08.968 --> 0:02:10.238
stronger drought severity. However, that

86
0:02:10.238 --> 0:02:11.456
is to some extent, as for instance you

87
0:02:11.456 --> 0:02:12.386
can look at Northeast which has the

88
0:02:12.386 --> 0:02:13.938
lowest annual precipitation but only has

89
0:02:14.044 --> 0:02:15.350
around three points to the left,

90
0:02:15.786 --> 0:02:17.397
compared to Cape Cod and Islands which has

91
0:02:17.621 --> 0:02:18.891
actually five points to the left. And

92
0:02:19.350 --> 0:02:19.968
then lastly, we just have our

93
0:02:19.968 --> 0:02:21.162
acknowledgement page. Thank you for

94
0:02:21.162 --> 0:02:21.662
listening.
