00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.960
Hello everyone. So this is our project 

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.040
diverting droughts with data, designing 

3
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.920
a visualization tool to drive water 

4
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.950
conservation efforts across 

5
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.970
Massachusetts. This is our group Jethro, 

6
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.770
Michelle and me. So now let's dive into 

7
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.860
our website. So here is our website. You 

8
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.810
have a toolbar here that helps you to 

9
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.430
navigate to different tabs. So here's 

10
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.810
the about page which you have this 

11
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.390
motivation, a description of why we did 

12
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.650
our project and then the background, the 

13
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.200
data, a description of the data, how we 

14
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.610
got the data, how data was collected. 

15
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.150
And then here you have raw link to the 

16
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.820
source of data. And the second tab is 

17
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.410
Massachusetts map. So you have a map 

18
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.200
of the different regions in 

19
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.710
Massachusetts. Here you have a legend.

20
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.740
The colors respond to the legend and 

21
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.260
then if you zoom in, zoom out you can 

22
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.850
see like closer regions and if you click 

23
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.650
on a marker like this it will show you 

24
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.490
the county names. So basically you have 

25
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.300
to choose which county you live in and 

26
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.590
then you locate the region that this 

27
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.140
county falls in to see where you are. 

28
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.590
And then here you have 

29
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.940
line chart and scatter plot. So here you 

30
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.260
have a line chart and a scatter plot. So 

31
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.920
this is the name, this is a description 

32
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.470
of how to use these charts. And then you 

33
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.830
have definition of SPI and then 

34
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.690
basically you can filter 

35
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.640
the possible regions. So if I select 

36
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.450
Cape Cod and Connecticut and then here 

37
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.200
is a legend. So if you click a year like

38
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.860
 2003, you click display line chart, 

39
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.200
you will have a line chart. So here you 

40
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,330
have a line and then you hover over a 

41
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.400
point on the line you can see this 

42
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.190
description like region or 

43
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.190
precipitation and year so like this. And 

44
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.530
then here if you select a year for the 

45
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.760
scatter plot like 2017, 2018 and you 

46
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.240
select month like April, May and then 

47
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.370
you click display scatter plot then 

48
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.590
you'll have the points. And you 

49
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.140
hover over a point, you can see the 

50
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.050
description of point like the 

51
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.190
region, the three month SPI value,the 

52
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.040
precipitation, the year and the month. 

53
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.290
Now the 4th tab, here is a linked bar 

54
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.870
and scatter plot. So here you have the 

55
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.160
titles. This is a description of how to 

56
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.360
use these bars and then the definition 

57
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.890
of SPI. So basically you select a year

58
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.290
 like 2018 and then you click get data. A

59
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.740
nd then this is the legend of the 

60
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.760
regions and you also have to region 

61
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.940
names down here. And then you hover over 

62
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.210
a bar, you can see the description of 

63
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.330
the bar, like the region, the annual 

64
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.690
precipitation value, the year. H

65
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.770
over over a point, you can see 

66
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.740
the description of the point like the 

67
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.610
region the three month SPI value, the 

68
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.650
year, and the month. You click on the 

69
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,420
bar, it will highlight the corresponding 

70
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.540
points. And then if you see 

71
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.540
this division here, 0 value. P

72
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.460
oints fall under this means very 

73
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.830
bad severity of droughts. Points above 

74
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.270
this line means less severity of 

75
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.290
droughts.And then if you like, select a 

76
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.150
point, it would correspond back to the 

77
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.680
bar that of the region that it falls in. 

78
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.140
And then if you go to the next 

79
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.390
page, it's our acknowledgement page, 

80
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.210
which is the resource that we used to 

81
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.810
help us make our website. So this is the 

82
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.880
overall of our website.
